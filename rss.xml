            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Colorado's Woody Creek Distillers</h1><p>Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze assembling in the States. While the complete results won't be formally announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch Colorado Straight Rye.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b64dca9b02fd08fb329890c39fa2430abff82993.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The original source material, "Old Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1d32105a54d9d89e483ba0384354f52d2dcf9ef.jpg"></article>]]></description>
